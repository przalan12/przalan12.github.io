            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">Hello! My name is Alan Perez and I am a fourth year student studying computer science. One of the reasons I am in this class
                is to explore how media can be transformed and shaped through the integration of computer science principles. 
                As a computer science student, I am curious about the potential impact of computers in the design of new media. I look forward to reading more on the subject and creating projects in this class with others.

            <p class="text-lg">One of the challenges I sometimes face when consuming media is the little control I have to influence the story. Whether that be in a TV show or video game, there are times when the content leaves me dissatisfied - wishing I could do something about it. As a content generator, I like to take a lot of photos and videos. However, a challenge I sometimes face is having to find the right photo to upload to social media. The abundance of captured moments often leads to a dilemma of selecting the most meaningful and visually appealing content, creating a balance between personal significance and audience engagement.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What would you add to your hierarchy of media or describe as issues that you did not identify in your first assignment?</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">By viewing other people's answers, I was able to identify some things I did not identify. Some students went as far as to categorize frequently media based on
                    situation like school - github and canvas. I also see people were really detailed by providing a variety of examples to media categories. Given the oppourtunity to revise my content from assigment one,
                    I would love to show more media usage and provide a little more in depth examples to showcase the world my media usage and interests. Regarding challenges, a lot of people had some really good thoughts 
                    I overlooked. Some went to categorizing the different challenges based on a particular genre of media. This made it really easy to see identify the issues student's had regarding their specific media. One particular theme
                    I saw common which was not surprising since we all use it everyday were related to streaming media. I missed to categorize a common media usage in my almost daily rouitine. Given the time to go back, I would add this to my hierachy of media, as 
                    one student mentioned they had difficulty with ads being placed with services one pays a subscription for. </p>
